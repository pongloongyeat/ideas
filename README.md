# Ideas

Mostly just ideas I have that I'll probably work on for a few days and forget about it :p

Contact me if you'd like to start on an idea of mine and I'd be glad to contribute!

## Wingpanel Drives Indicator

The Pantheon DE provides no way of knowing when someone has plugged in their removable USB drive. Since elementary's HIG reserves indicators for *system* statuses, adding a drive indicator would probably work here.

Ideally, it should show the drive and its available volumes (much like Files shows it) and clicking on the volume should mount it and open it in Files.
